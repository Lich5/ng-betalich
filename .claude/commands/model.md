# Model Selection

Choose the right Claude model for your task:

## 🏗️ Claude Sonnet 4.5
**Best for:** Architecture, design, planning, complex reasoning

Use for:
- System design and architecture decisions
- Breaking down complex features
- Technical planning and strategy
- Code review and analysis
- Debugging complex issues
- Writing documentation

**To switch:** `/model claude-sonnet-4-5`

---

## ⚡ Claude Haiku 4.5
**Best for:** Implementation, coding, testing, quick tasks

Use for:
- Writing and editing code
- Running tests
- Fixing straightforward bugs
- Implementing well-defined features
- Refactoring code
- Quick iterations

**To switch:** `/model claude-haiku-4-5`

---

**Current model:** Check with `claude config get model` or look at session startup info

**Tip:** Use `/arch` to enter architecture mode (reminds you to use Sonnet), or `/code` for implementation mode (reminds you to use Haiku).

Which model would you like to use?
