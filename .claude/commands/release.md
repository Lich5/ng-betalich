# Release Management

Focus on release preparation, versioning, and changelog management.

**Release checklist:**
1. Review all changes since last release
2. Update CHANGELOG.md following Keep a Changelog format
3. Ensure version bumps follow semantic versioning
4. Verify all tests pass
5. Check for breaking changes and document them
6. Review release-please configuration if applicable
7. Ensure dependencies are up to date
8. Tag and prepare release notes

**Lich ecosystem considerations:**
- Modular release patterns
- Cross-gem dependencies
- Ruby version compatibility
- Gem packaging and publishing
