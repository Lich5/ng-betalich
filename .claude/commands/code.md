# Implementation Mode

**Switching to implementation mode.**

> **Recommended model:** Claude Haiku 4.5 (use `/model claude-haiku-4-5` if not already active)

Focus on:
- Writing clean, efficient Ruby code
- Following established patterns in the codebase
- Writing comprehensive tests (RSpec)
- Fixing bugs and implementing features
- Optimizing for performance and readability

Ready to implement. What would you like me to build or fix?
