# Debug Mode

Systematic debugging approach for Ruby applications.

**Debug workflow:**
1. Reproduce the issue
2. Gather error messages and stack traces
3. Identify the failing component
4. Examine relevant code paths
5. Check logs and test output
6. Form hypothesis about root cause
7. Test fix and verify resolution

**Common debugging tools:**
- RSpec for test-driven debugging
- Ruby debugger (binding.pry, debug)
- Log analysis
- Stack trace interpretation
- Dependency version conflicts

**Questions to ask:**
- What's the expected behavior?
- What's the actual behavior?
- What changed recently?
- Can it be reproduced consistently?

What issue are you debugging?
