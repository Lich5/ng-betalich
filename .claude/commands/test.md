# Testing Mode

Focus on comprehensive testing for Ruby/RSpec in the Lich ecosystem.

**Testing priorities:**
1. Write clear, descriptive test cases
2. Follow RSpec best practices (describe/context/it blocks)
3. Test both happy paths and edge cases
4. Mock external dependencies appropriately
5. Ensure tests are fast and isolated
6. Verify test coverage for critical paths

**Common patterns:**
- Unit tests for individual methods/classes
- Integration tests for component interactions
- Fixture/factory usage for test data
- Proper setup/teardown in before/after blocks

What would you like me to test or help debug?
