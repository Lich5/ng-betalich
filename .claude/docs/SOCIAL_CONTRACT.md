# Social Contract - Product Owner & Development Team

**Established:** October 30, 2025  
**Status:** Active  
**Last Modified:** October 30, 2025 - Added Expectation 10

---

## Core Expectations

### 1. No Surprises Rule
**Product Owner Expectation:** I hate surprises. If I don't ask for it, don't deliver it.

**Development Response:** Deliver exactly what's specified. No bonus features. No assumptions about "what you might want."

---

### 2. Call Out Violations
**Product Owner Expectation:** If these expectations are violated, I will call it out crisply. Help me limit token waste by following these rules.

**Development Response:** Expect direct feedback on violations. Make violations rare by actually following the contract.

---

### 3. Product Owner Sets Requirements
**Product Owner Expectation:** I define requirements, primarily UI/UX. You surface architectural concerns only when they genuinely impact user experience or maintainability.

**Development Response:** Follow the requirements as specified. Only raise architectural issues that materially affect what was asked for.

---

### 4. Clarify First, Always
**Product Owner Expectation:** Your time is precious. No rework. Err on caution and ask for clarification first. Always. Even if you think you know the answer.

**Development Response:** When in doubt, ask. No guessing. No assumptions. Clarification is cheaper than rework.

---

### 5. SOLID + DRY + Clear Documentation
**Product Owner Expectation:** Code must be well-architected (SOLID), non-repetitive (DRY), easily understood, and documented (inline + YARD). I'll spend tokens on good documentation.

**Development Response:** 
- Follow SOLID principles
- Don't repeat yourself
- Write clear, maintainable code
- Document inline and with YARD
- Make documentation crisp, clear, and additive

---

### 6. You Own Quality
**Product Owner Expectation:** I evaluate from product perspective (UI/UX, performance, maintainability). I won't review code line-by-line. You're responsible for technical execution being sound.

**Development Response:** Own the quality of design, logic, and execution. Product owner evaluates outcomes, not implementation details.

---

### 7. Tests Are Mandatory
**Product Owner Expectation:** Design unit tests, functional tests, and integration tests. Not optional. Same quality bar as code.

**Development Response:** 
- Unit tests for components
- Functional tests for features  
- Integration tests for workflows
- Same documentation and quality standards apply

---

### 8. Zero Regression
**Product Owner Expectation:** When refactoring/modernizing: nothing breaks. Zero tolerance.

**Development Response:** Test everything. Verify nothing regresses. Zero means zero.

---

### 9. Less Is More
**Product Owner Expectation:** Don't over-engineer. Reuse aggressively. Keep architecture practical. No "every method needs its own class" nonsense.

**Development Response:** 
- Simple beats clever
- Reuse everything possible
- Don't overcomplicate architecture
- Practical over perfect

---

### 10. Evidence-Based Analysis
**Product Owner Expectation:** When answering questions about code behavior, research the codebase first. Show evidence only when uncertain, ambiguous, or if challenged.

**Development Response:**
- Always trace execution paths from entry point to conclusion
- Search for all relevant files (grep, file search, cross-references)
- Provide answers based on proven code behavior, not assumptions
- When uncertain or ambiguous: Show summary of what was assessed and where uncertainty lies
- When challenged: Provide full evidence chain with file paths and line numbers

**What to avoid:**
- Assumptions based on "similar codebases" or templates
- Statements like "probably does X" without verification
- Answering without checking if the answer is in the code

**When to show evidence:**
- Cannot find definitive answer in code
- Found ambiguous or contradictory behavior
- Product owner challenges a claim
